# Run RAG in google colab

Google colab : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ScKXl9Oxt5Ahvmgyqn1H7gGrHGUwhy3_?usp=sharing

## Steps

1. Log into google and follow the link above
2. Upload all the files in the 'colab-data' directory in this repo to the colab session root

   Colab > File > Upload to session storage > 'colab-data' dir files

   These files will dissapear when you shut down colab, so you will will need to re-upload

3. Colab > Runtime > Run All. This could take a while the first time as it needs to download everything
4. At the end of this you will have Ollama running, and the chromadb vector database setup
5. Play around
